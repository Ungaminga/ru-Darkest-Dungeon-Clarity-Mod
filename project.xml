	<ItemDescription>You no longer need to look at the Wiki for damn near everything!!!
	
	Key Features:
	- More Quirk Information! Ever wanted to know what exactly Egomania does? You do now!
	- More Curio Information! Now you can have your Blight resistant hero open Curios that cause Blight!
	- More Information on Enemy Attacks! If they deal Damage, Require specific Ranks, or Target specific Ranks now you know!
	- Clearer Items! Along with a Curio interaction list by area. No need to think &quot;What does antitoxin do in the Cove?&quot;
	- Tips on quests based on areas. Going to the Cove? Grab some extra Shovels!
	- Boss Previews before starting a quest! No more &quot;Uh-Oh! His stun resistance is actually pretty high!&quot;
	
	And more!
	
	Still in development, so far only partially covers the crimson courtyard content, but more support coming soon!</ItemDescription>
